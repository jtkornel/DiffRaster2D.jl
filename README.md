# DiffRaster2D.jl - Differentiable 2d rasterizer in Julia

A basic rasterizer which lets you take any image and create a vector-graphics rendering from it, using the same techiques that form the backbone of deep learning.

By using [signed distance functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function) (SDF) to represent geometric primitives, and rendering with 1d anti-aliasing, one can get a fully differentiable graphics pipeline. That in turn makes it possible to set up a loss funtion for a rendered image against some reference image, and optimize the rendering parameters to minimize the loss using gradient search techniques. The SDF technique for graphics is not novel, but using it for differentiable 2d-rendering like here was recently described in [this paper by Tzu-Mao Li and collaborators](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tzumao/diffvg/diffvg.pdf) 

The code and experiments here demonstrate that SDF does not _necessarily imply_ conflation artifacts as [previous art](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tzumao/diffvg/diffvg.pdf) may seem to indicate, just that one has to take care not to _conflate_ pixel transparency, pixel coverage, confidence or other uses of the alpha channel in the rasterizer. When targeting SVG or other established formats this may possibly be more challenging, but when defining the rasterizer from the ground up it is not an issue.

This toolbox shows the concept using the [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl) framework in [Julia](https://julialang.org). It is work in progress and only supports a few primitives.

To test, run `examples/visualize_circle_recovery.jl`

This shows selected iterations when fitting a shaded circle:

For a more advanced example fitting a triangle mesh to a raster image, run `examples/triangle_mesh_optimization.jl`

By running for quite a few iterations you should get something like this:

## Todo-list

* Tailor for more efficient gradients from Zygote 
* Faster rendering with tiles or kD-tree
